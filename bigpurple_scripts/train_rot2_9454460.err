/gpfs/scratch/bz957/Motion_Correction/Pytorch-UNet-master/utils/dataset.py:33: FutureWarning: Using a non-tuple sequence for multidimensional indexing is deprecated; use `arr[tuple(seq)]` instead of `arr[seq]`. In the future this will be interpreted as an array index, `arr[np.array(seq)]`, which will result either in an error or a different result.
